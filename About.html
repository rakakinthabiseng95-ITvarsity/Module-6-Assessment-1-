            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>We are a group of students who want to share with everyone some of the most beautiful places that we've visited or learned about. We want to share our passion with everyone.</p>
            <p>There are so many beautiful places in the world that many people do not know about. </p>
            <p>Our aim is to have a site where people can come and learn about these places as well as pass time and just relax and destress. </p>
